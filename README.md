SABR
----

This is a collection of various SQL queries that can be executed on the Lahman Database (http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) and various scripts to process the results. These are fairly basic and are simply things that I find interesting or useful. 

For scripts, I will try and include the query used to produce the data (if it is not one of the frequent queries) as a comment at the top of the script.

Note: Most queries will have a date or league specified, but these can easily be modified.
